# HealthSlate Coorporate Website
http://healthslate.com

Working with a UI designer, I rebuilt the entire HealthSlate corporate website. Some of the text and graphics remained the same, but I built the website with a new and modern design. 
I made the website a mobile first design, because 65% of HealthSlate customers use their mobile as their primary access to the internet. I created a dynamic drop down navigation menu, for mobile, and a nav bar across the top of the screen for larger screen users. 

I added several original pages including Partner With Us, Outcomes, and Coming Soon, each with different challenges. I added several web forms for current and potential customers to communicate with HealthSlate.  Each web form is linked to a Form Spree for fast and seamless communication between the website and the marketing team. 

## Built With
* [MetalSmith.js](http://www.metalsmith.io/)
* HTML/CSS/javascrip 
* CSS Flexbox
* [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/) For web form communication
