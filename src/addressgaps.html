	                 		<p>The HealthSlateÂ® Program enables accredited/ recognized diabetes education centers to support patients unable or unwilling to attend in-person Diabetes Education and Medical Nutrition Therapy. Instead, the patient receives education, professional counseling and peer support via their mobile device. The program is intended to squarely address two of the biggest gaps in DSME and MNT: most patients who need these services do not or cannot access them, and those who do access them often lack the long-term support needed to maintain gains. The HealthSlate Program includes:</p>

	                      	<li><strong>Video-calling and secure messaging</strong> for 1:1 education and support sessions between the DE or RD and patient.</li>
	                          <li><strong>An evidence-based, standards compliant 12-week curriculum</strong> developed by Certified Diabetes Educators that covers all of the educational content typically found in group DSME and MNT classes. The curriculum is delivered via short, consumer friendly videos.</li>
	                          <li><strong>User-friendly and low literacy tools and games</strong> for remembering to take medications, learning carb counting, meal planning, and logging self-care behaviors. Patients can electronically download glucose test results to the app, and can log meals by merely taking a picture; dietitians employed by HealthSlate estimate the nutritional values and share that information with the patient. Physical activity is encouraged and tracked via a waterproof tracker that the patient never needs to re-charge.</li>
	                          <li><strong>A support group of other people in the program</strong>, who share low carb food ideas, physical activity progress, and encouragement.</li>
	                      </ol>
	                      <p>Patients in the program maintain their health improvements because they stay connected with their DE and support group even after the initial education is completed. The program has shown outstanding engagement and health outcomes in initial field trials. Moreover, in several states insurers are now required to cover DSME and MNT when delivered via telehealth.  The HealthSlate Program conforms to the National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education and Support.  Note: This program does not provide recommendations for altering previously prescribed treatment. </p>
