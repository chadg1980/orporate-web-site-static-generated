<h6> January 8, 2016</h6>
<p>
BELLEVUE, Wash – HealthSlate LLC today announced the launch of HealthSlate Diabetes Telehealth, which enables health care providers to offer proven diabetes education and support services via “virtual care.” People who are unable to visit the clinic regularly can now connect with their diabetes education and care team from anywhere, and receive a level of high-touch support not previously possible.</p>

<p>The service has been in pilot testing for several months with Cascade Health Solutions, CHI Franciscan Health, EvergreenHealth, and Providence Health & Services, and has demonstrated patient engagement equal to or better than is seen from in-clinic diabetes education programs. Based on these documented successes, several health systems in the U.S. are planning to deploy HealthSlate Diabetes Telehealth in 2016.</p>

<p>“We are delighted to be working with these forward-thinking healthcare providers, as they are enabling people with diabetes to manage their condition in a way that works with the practical realities of their daily life,” said Dan Sheeran, CEO, HealthSlate.  </p>

<p>Sonya Kauffman Smith, RD, CDE, lead educator for Providence says, “Members love features such as regular check-ins via text and video chat. Having all of their meals and blood sugar data on the dashboard helps me understand what is going on with them in real time.” 
“CHI Franciscan Health is committed to changing the status quo of healthcare,” said Lana Adzhigirey RN MN CPHQ, Program Manager of Care Transformation, CHI Franciscan Health. “Our Diabetes Education Services, led by Katie Farrell, RD CDE, have been on the cutting edge for several years. We have witnessed first-hand how patients’ lives are turned around because services like HealthSlate Diabetes Telehealth provide them easy access to the support and information they need when they need it.” </p>
<p>
HealthSlate Diabetes Telehealth includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Personalized counseling from diabetes educators via two-way video and secure messaging. </li>
<li>Photo-food logging. No more logging each meal and manually calculating its nutritional values.  “Concierge nutritionists” help the consumer understand what’s in their meals.</li>
<li>Tools for creating and achieving behavioral goals.</li>
<li>Automatic downloads from fitness trackers, scales and glucose monitors.</li>
<li>Educational videos and games.</li>
<li>An online support group.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Healthslate Diabetes Telehealth can also be integrated within the health care team, such that primary care and specialty providers can access information about the patient’s self-management activities and outcomes and remotely support the patient if desired. The platform is particularly well suited for patient-centered care and chronic care management models.</p>
<p>
Approximately 30 million people in the U.S. have diabetes, and allowing the condition to advance uncontrolled is a major source of health complications and cost. Diabetes self-management education has been proven in randomized clinical trials to help people better control their condition. However, less than 10% of people who would benefit from these programs access them because they require multiple trips to the clinic, and involve practices such as food logging, that many people find difficult to stick with.
