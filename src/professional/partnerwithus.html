                    <h4>
                            Over half of our participants achieve the CDC goal of at least 5% weight loss for people at high risk for diabetes. Our deployments for diabetes management have consistently demonstrated A1C glucose decreases of over 1.0%, which is equivalent (but cheaper!) than putting someone on a new drug. Our programs are all evidence-based and compliant with CDC, ADA and AHA clinical recommendations.

                        We offer very low-cost programs that can be provided to all employees or plan members as a covered wellness benefit and premium programs that can be targeted to only those people at highest risk of developing diabetes or heart disease, or who are already diagnosed and are struggling to manage their condition. And our premium programs are all pay-for-performance; we only get paid as participants engage and succeed.

                        Some participants prefer an all-digital program. Some prefer in-person. Many people like the option of combining the two “(Hybrid programs”) to accommodate their busy schedules. We offer programs under all three models, and provide you a single set of resources for tracking participants in all three models.

                    Moreover, all Medicare Advantage (MA) plans are required to cover the Medicare DPP starting April 1, 2018. Our programs are compliant with both the USPSTF and CMS requirements. In fact, we pioneered the “virtual makeup” concept that CMS has adopted, allowing participants more flexibility in how they participate.
