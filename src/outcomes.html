            <p>
                All HealthSlate programs, both our clinical programs and our
                lifestyle change programs, are based on thoroughly tested and
                proven, evidence-based approaches and standards. We have
                adapted those approaches to a digital delivery format and then
                proven that we can obtain equal or superior health outcomes while
                addressing the largest challenge that traditional in-person
                programs face: most people cannot or will not participate in-person
                over the many months needed to effect long term change.

            <h3>The Evidence-Based Models We Follow</h3>
            <p>
                We focus on prevention and management of obesity,
                diabetes and cardiovascular disease. We follow the
                guidelines and specific interventions of the leading medical
                authorities, including the CDC, ADA, AHA, and AADE. While
                the primary outcomes measures vary depending on which
                specific condition is being targeted, all of these conditions
                are best managed through patient education, selfmanagement
                tools, and coaching aimed at:

        <h2>The Evidence We Deliver</h2>
        <p>
                With nearly 10,000 people now having enrolled
                in HealthSlate programs we have demonstrated
                repeatedly that we can help far more people
                accomplish the goals of these programs than is
                possible through in-person programs.
                Specifically, we consistently deliver:
                Over 50% lose at least 5% of body weight.
                And we also help the other 50% because we
                also average…

        <h2>350 minutes/week of physical activity among all
                participants</h2>
                <p>
                    vs. the 150 minute/week targets established by the CDC, ADA, AHA, and
                    AADE. (And this is not self-reported; our activity data is validated through
                    use of activity trackers and smartwatches!) Physical activity is extremely
                    important because even people who fail to lose weight tend to see clinically
                    significant improvements in blood sugar (diabetes risk) and blood pressure
                    if they get at least 150 minutes of activity week, and often, the more activity
                    the greater the benefit, i.e., a “dose effect.”

            “Recent studies provide further evidence to
            support the notion that regular physical activity
            (PA) reduces the risk of insulin resistance,
            metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and
            insulin sensitivity improves when individuals
            comply with exercise and/or PA guidelines.
            Many studies indicate a dose response, with
            higher energy expenditures and higher exercise
            intensities…producing greater benefits.”
