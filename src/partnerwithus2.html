            <h2>Proven Outcomes</h2>
            <p>
                Over half of our participants achieve the CDC 
                goal of at least 5% weight loss for people at 
                high risk for diabetes. Our deployments for
                diabetes management have consistently
                demonstrated A1C glucose decreases of over 
                1.0%, which is equivalent (but cheaper!) than 
                putting someone on a new drug. Our programs 
                are all evidence-based and compliant with CDC, 
                ADA and AHA clinical recommendations.

                        We offer very low-cost programs that can be
                        provided to all employees or plan members as a
                        covered wellness benefit and premium
                        programs that can be targeted to only those
                        people at highest risk of developing diabetes or
                        heart disease, or who are already diagnosed
                        and are struggling to manage their condition.
                        And our premium programs are all pay-for-
                        performance; we only get paid as participants
                         engage and succeed.
