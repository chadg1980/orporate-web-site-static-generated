<p>A TO Z HEALTH AND HEALTHSLATE Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Effective October 12, 2013 Version 1.01</p>
<p>I. Our Commitment to Privacy This A to Z Health and HealthSlate Privacy Policy (“Policy”) sets forth the information privacy practices of Informational Media Brands, LLC (collectively “A to Z” “we” or “us”) in connection with your use of the A to Z websites, the HealthSlate tablet, mobile applications provided by A to Z, and/or any other service provided by A to Z that includes a link to, or otherwise references, this Policy (collectively, the “Services”). A to Z respects your privacy and is committed to ensuring that your personal information is respected and protected consistent with this Policy. This Policy discloses the information we gather through the Services, the ways we process, share and secure such information and how you can correct or change it. Except where otherwise expressly indicated herein or in the Services, this Policy applies only to information collected through the Services and does not apply to information collected outside of the Services, such as information collected offline.</p>
<p>This Policy addresses our privacy practices relating to the use of the Services. Anyone who visits, browses or otherwise uses the Services (collectively, “you” or “user”) is subject to this Policy. Before using and submitting any information to the Services, please read this Policy. By using the Services, including the submission of any personal information, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Policy and consent to having your data transferred to and/or processed in the United States. If you do not agree to this Policy, you are not permitted to use the Services.</p>
<p>II. The Information We Collect We do not require you to submit any more information than is necessary to use the Services effectively. We may collect the following three categories of information from you: (a) Personally Identifiable Information (PII); (b) Non-Personal Information; and (c) Passive Anonymous Information. All three of these categories are collectively referred to as “Information” in this Policy.</p>
<p>A. Personally Identifiable Information Collected from Individuals We may receive and store any information you enter through the Services that is intended to allow us or third parties to identify you personally, contact you or identify other individuals. This information is referred to as PII. The PII you provide to us only will be used by A to Z in accordance with this Policy. Examples of PII we may collect from you:</p>
<p>Your first and last name, email address, postal address, user name, or telephone number; Financial information, such as credit, debit or bank account information to purchase a product or service; A membership number in a medical society such as the American Association of Diabetes Educators (AADE). PII you provide about yourself or others when you send us an e-mail, contact support or otherwise communicate with us. Sometimes A to Z will aggregate and/or anonymize PII so that it becomes non-personal information and is not intended to be used to personally identify you.</p>
<p>B. Non-Personal Information From time to time, we may also ask you to provide us with non-personal information which is data that alone is not intended to allow us to identify you personally, such as just your first name, zip code, or the healthcare facility that is a using a HealthSlate tablet. We may also collect information that you choose to provide concerning specific health indicators, such as blood pressure readings; however, such information is not linked with or otherwise associated with PII. C. Passive Anonymous Information Gathered Electronically We and our third party partners may automatically collect certain types of passive, anonymous information whenever you use the Services, such as information about your device, your computer, and online activities. For instance, we may automatically collect Services usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of users of the Services, pages visited and similar data. This data is used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that A to Z intends to use to identify you personally. If we collect this information, it will be done passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs (and similar technologies) and location information from your wireless equipment as explained below. Cookies: We and our advertising partners may use “cookies.” When you use the Services, the pages you see, along with something called “cookies,” may be downloaded to your device or computer. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your device or computer. These cookies do not contain or collect any PII, but may be used to deliver content specific to your interests, to control the number of times you see an advertisement while using the Services, to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns, to provide analytics concerning use of the Services, and for other purposes, such as security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Services. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can change your browser to limit or prevent cookies. Cookies in themselves do not personally identify the individual user, but rather the computer or device that is being used to access our Services. You may have the opportunity to set your computer or device to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Different browsers may address cookies differently. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services not being provided to you when you use that computer or device. Web beacons, Pixels and Clear GIFs: We and our advertising partners may use web beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track website usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies are not placed on your computer or device. This information helps us to improve our Services and helps our advertising partners by measuring the effectiveness of these communications with you. These technologies may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with our Service or advertisements made by our advertising partners.</p>
<p>Device Information: You can access and use the Services via different types of devices, including computers, tablets and smartphones. Depending on the device used, we and our third party vendors may collect certain device information. For instance, in order to provide analytics concerning the Services, the following information may be collected: hardware and software types, browser information, IP address, and device identifiers. When you use the Services on a wireless device, including your own device or the HealthSlate tablet, the Services may provide additional functionality by using the location of your wireless device (including the city, state and/or country where you were located when you download a mobile application. III. information shared with a to z by others As part of the Services, third parties, including physicians, health clinics and health educators (collectively, “Covered Entities”) may share with A to Z certain patient information, including protected health information, as that term is defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This information is collected by the Covered Entities and subject to any privacy notice provided by the Covered Entities to the user. A to Z Health does not collect this information but has access to it as part of the services it provides to Covered Entities and is obligated to protect such information pursuant to HIPAA. Any other information that A to Z receives about a user from a third party is subject to that third parties’ privacy notice and practices.</p>
<p>IV. How We Use Information We may use your Information for a number of purposes, including:</p>
<p>To allow you to use the Services and to administer your account; To facilitate communication between A to Z and you including, without limitation, responding to your questions or comments, sending e-mails concerning our products and services, to contact you for feedback regarding us, advertisers or business partners, or to communicate with you for customer support; To provide you with information about products or services that we think you will find valuable; For our marketing and promotional activities and to statistically analyze the use of the Services; To provide a report for us or to our advertisers or business partners that tells them who responded to a particular offer or to facilitate the fulfillment of an order that you have made with an advertiser or business partner; To provide you with important functionality changes to the Services, new A to Z services and special offers from A to Z that we think you will find valuable; To customize, personalize, analyze, evaluate, adjust and improve the Services to meet the needs and expectations of you, A to Z, our affiliates and our advertisers or business partners; To sign you up for our email newsletter, or with your permission enter you into a sweepstakes; To anonymize or aggregate PII for various purposes like market analysis or traffic flow analysis and reporting and other internal purposes; and To enforce our agreements with you, prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities, for other legally permissible purposes and generally to ensure that we comply with applicable laws. V. Advertising AND DO NOT TRACK The Services may include contextual advertisements based on your use of the Services, information that you provide to A to Z, or information that we obtain from third parties. A to Z does not respond to Internet browser “Do-Not-Track” signals because it does not engage in the activities that Do-Not-Track signals are intended to address, namely, the tracking of users over time and across third party websites (such as through the use of cookies or similar technologies). In addition, A to Z does not permit third parties to engage in such tracking on the Services. VI.
