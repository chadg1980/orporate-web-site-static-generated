            <p>
                Over half of our participants achieve the CDC 
                goal of at least 5% weight loss for people at 
                high risk for diabetes. Our deployments for diabetes
                management have consistently demonstrated A1C
                glucose decreases of over 1.0%, which is similar
                to putting someone on a new drug, only cheaper.
                Our programs are all evidence-based and compliant 
                with CDC, ADA and AHA clinical recommendations.

                We offer very low-cost programs that can be
                provided to all employees or plan members as a
                covered wellness benefit and premium
                programs that can be targeted to only those
                people at highest risk of developing diabetes or
                heart disease, or who are already diagnosed
                and are struggling to manage their condition.
                And our premium programs are all pay-for-
                performance; we only get paid as participants
                    engage and succeed.

                Some participants prefer an all-digital program.
                Some prefer in-person. Many people like the
                option of combining the two “(Hybrid programs”) 
                to accommodate their busy schedules. We offer
                programs under all three models, and provide 
                you a single set of resources for tracking 
                participants in all three models.

                    All non-grandfathered health plans are required
                    to cover diabetes prevention programs (DPPs)
                    because of the USPSTF’s Grade B 
                    recommendation, and the Institute for Clinical
                    and Economic Review recommends coverage
                    because of the program’s proven effectiveness.
                </p><p>
                    Moreover, all Medicare Advantage (MA) plans 
                    are required to cover the Medicare DPP starting 
                    April 1, 2018. Our programs are compliant with 
                    both the USPSTF and CMS requirements. In 
                    fact, we pioneered the “virtual makeup” concept
                    that CMS has adopted, allowing participants
                     more flexibility in how they participate.
