I recently joined the HealthSlate program, which helps people reduce their risk of diabetes and lose weight. It’s free and it’s totally not like a traditional “crash diet.” It’s about long-term lifestyle changes that you can stick with. You get a personal health coach, a Fitbit, and a wireless scale. And you go through it with a group, which can include your family and friends. I thought you might want to go through the program with me or on your own.

If you’re interested just go to http://solera4me.com/hsrefer, and take the one minute survey to see if you are eligible. After the survey choose the “I know the Program I want” button and then choose HealthSlate.

Thanks!`);
