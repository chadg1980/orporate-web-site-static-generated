                <h2>  Medicare to cover diabetes prevention. This is BIG. </h2>
                  <h6> 3/31/2016 </h6>
                <P>
                    The news last week that Medicare would soon start <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/us/politics/medicare-proposal-takes-aim-at-diabetes.html?_r=0">cov
ering diabetes prevention programs (DPP)</a> is transformative, not just for companies <a href="http://healthslate.com">like ours</a> that provide such programs but also for the 8
6 million American citizens (including an estimated one in two adults in California) who have prediabetes and their families. People who participate in a DPP cut their risk of dev
eloping type 2 diabetes by 58%, and seniors reduce their risk by an astounding 71%. In addition to the direct impact of covering seniors, the Medicare news will further accelerate
 coverage for diabetes prevention among commercial health plans, which were already starting to add such coverage because of recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventative Serv
ices Task Force. </P>

<p>It’s kind of hard to believe that the government got this so right. By supporting both in-person programs like those offered by the Y and Weight Watchers as well as digital pro
grams, Medicare will enable people to get help in the manner that best works for them. We have found that, perhaps not surprisingly, over a third of people cannot or will not atte
nd an in-person program. This is based on <a href="http://soleranetwork.com/?p=995">our initial work with Solera Health</a>, through which our program is offered as an ACA-covered
 preventive benefits through Solera's contracts with several large commercial health plans. We have found that people who attend via a digital program often do as well as or bette
r than those attending in-person. Even people who do want an in-person experience often cannot make every session in person; giving them the option to make up missed classes onlin
e (while still being reimbursed by “payers”) can only improve the effectiveness of their DPP experience.</p>

<p>It’s also affirming to see that Medicare listened to and took seriously the very hard <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/upshot/the-unsung-success-of-a-diabetes-prevent
ion-program.html">work by so many people </a> on this for the past 15 years, including our many friends at the American Association of Diabetes Educators.  It’s hard to remember h
ow many times I have been told by a diabetes education program director, “We’d love to provide diabetes prevention to more people, but no one pays for prevention.” Soon those prog
rams will be able to offer prevention. We look forward to being the <a href="http://healthslate.com/professional/index.html">technology partner </a> that makes that possible. </p>

<p>Next we’ll need to get the word out. Many people with prediabetes do not know they are at risk, that now or soon they can attend a (free!) program to tackle it (see <a href="ht
tp://dpp4me.com">dpp4me.com</a>), and that they won’t need to give up all of their favorite foods. Healthcare providers and HR benefits folks at employers need to know that resour
ces are available to help their patients and employees.  Time to reach out to our marketing friends, and get them to pitch in.</p>
