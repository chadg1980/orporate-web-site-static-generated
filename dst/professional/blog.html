                <h2>  Medicare to cover diabetes prevention. This is BIG. </h2>
                <h6> 3/1/2016 </h6>
                <P>
                    The news last week that Medicare would soon start covering diabetes prevention programs (DPP) is transformative, not just for companies like ours that provide such programs but also for the 86 million American citizens (including an estimated one in two adults in California) who have prediabetes and their families. People who participate in a DPP cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by 58%, and seniors reduce their risk by an astounding 71%. In addition to the direct impact of covering seniors, the Medicare news will further accelerate coverage for diabetes prevention among commercial health plans, which were already starting to add such coverage because of recent recommendations from the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force. </p>


    <p>It’s kind of hard to believe that the government got this so right. By supporting both in-person programs like those offered by the Y and Weight Watchers as well as digital programs, Medicare will enable people to get help in the manner that best works for them. In our work with Solera Health, which manages DPP on behalf of many large Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, we have found that, perhaps not surprisingly, over a third of people cannot or will not attend an in-person program. And those attending online often do as well as or better as those attending in-person (they do in the HealthSlate program ☺). Even people who do want an in-person experience often cannot make every session in person; being able to give them the option to make up missed classes online (while still being reimbursed by “payers”) can only improve the effectiveness of the their DPP experience.</p>

<p>It’s also affirming to see that Medicare listened to and took seriously the very hard work by so many people on this for the past 15 years, including our many friends at the American Association of Diabetes Educators.  It’s hard to remember how many times I have been told by a diabetes education program director, “We’d love to provide diabetes prevention to more people, but no one pays for prevention.” Soon those programs will be able to offer prevention. We look forward to being the technology partner that makes that possible.</p>

<p> Next we’ll need to get the word out. Many people with prediabetes do not know they are at risk, that now or soon they can attend a (free!) program to tackle it (see ddp4.me.com), and that they won’t need to give up all of their favorite foods. Healthcare providers and HR benefits folks at employers need to know that resources are available to help their patients and employees.  Time to reach out to our marketing friends, and get them to pitch in.
