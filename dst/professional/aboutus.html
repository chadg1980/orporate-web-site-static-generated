               		<p>While just about everyone knows that chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease are costly and challenging for clients, providers and health plans, far fewer people know that evidence-based, relatively low cost programs exist that have been proven to help people self-manage these conditions. Under the traditional care delivery model, however, most people who could benefit from these programs have not been able or willing to access them.</p>
                    <p>Mobile and cloud technologies, combined with fresh thinking by clinicians, are now making it possible for many more people to access these programs, and to maintain their gains over the long haul. </p>
                    <p>Our mission is to make that happen. We have worked with thousands of people with chronic conditions, and know which aspects of the evidence-based model work best for each patient situation. We also enjoy deep experience and demonstrated success building consumer experiences that educate and engage, and we know how to scale from pilot tests to large scale, mission critical operations. We understand the realities of today’s clinical workflow, billing and accreditation requirements, and we tap into the latest insights from cognitive psychology for sustained behavior change. </p>
