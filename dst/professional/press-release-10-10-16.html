                <h2>    HealthSlate DPP Platform Launches to Drive Consumer Engagement and 
Lower Costs of In-Person Diabetes Prevention Programs </h2>
          <h4> Software and Content to Be Deployed by Greater Los Angeles American Diabetes Association
and Achieving Better Control</h4>

<h6> October 10, 2016</h6>
<p>
SEATTLE, WA – HealthSlate LLC, a mobile health services provider, today launched the company’s HealthSlate DPP Platform, a suite of software products designed to reduce costs, drive consumer engagement and enhance the efficiency of in-person Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-recognized National Diabetes Prevention Programs (DPP). 
</p>
<p>
Currently, there are over 1,000 in-person DPPs available at the national and community level, each empowering patients with evidence-based programs that reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes and improve their overall health. However, to date, in person DPPs have faced a number of challenges related to driving and maintaining participant engagement and operating efficiently. The HealthSlate DPP platform was launched to address these issues by: 
</p><p><ul>
<li>Making it easier for participants to log activity, nutrition and weight; participants now use a mobile app instead of a paper tracker, and have the option to connect their Fitbit for automated activity tracking.</li>
<li>
Making the program accessible to people who cannot attend every session in-person; those sessions can now easily be made up via content modules in the app. </li>
<li>
Allowing Lifestyle Coaches to use secure messaging to stay in touch with participants, encourage them to stay on track, and remind them of the next session.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
The HealthSlate DPP Platform includes a digital implementation of the new CDC-approved Prevent T2 curriculum, enabling individuals to review session material outside of the classroom. Finally, the HealthSlate DPP Platform offers program participants the ability to stay in touch with one another between DPP sessions by posting to a Group Wall in the app, which has proven to have a significant impact on enhancing motivation and program success. 
</p><p>
Recognizing the value of the HealthSlate DPP platform, two community based organizations, The Greater Los Angeles American Diabetes Association and Achieving Better Control, have both announced plans to deploy the offering in their in-person DPPs starting later this year. 
</p><p>
“We are very excited to incorporate an online engagement and tracking component to our program,” said Alissa Singer, Senior Program Manger, Greater Los Angeles American Diabetes Association. “Providing the participants with the ability to communicate with their Lifestyle Coach and fellow program participants will help to continue the relationship building outside of the meeting time.”
</p><p>
“The new HealthSlate DPP platform fills in the gaps we’ve encountered in previous programs that used a pen and paper delivery,” said Mike Freedman, President, Achieving Better Control, Inc. “We are confident that we can use the platform to scale future DPP programs, as we aim to reach large populations of patients as we work towards the prevention of type 2 diabetes.”
</p><p>
In an effort to help in-person DPPs adopt digital technologies to enhance their program delivery, HealthSlate is also partnering with Solera Health, an integrated community health technology platform that connects patients, payers, and physicians with a new class of non-clinical healthcare providers, simply and securely. Solera Health is aligning with HealthSlate to help in-person DPPs  drive patient recruitment, obtain coverage for their programs from commercial health plans, perform revenue management, and report results in a CDC-compliant manner. 
</p><p>
“At HealthSlate, we strongly believe that national and community based DPPs specifically will continue to play a critical role in helping at-risk individuals take control of their health and keep chronic diseases at bay,” said Dan Sheeran, HealthSlate CEO. “However, many programs have faced challenges recruiting participants, maintaining initial weight loss, and gaining the operational efficiencies needed to expand their programs. We look forward to working with in-person DPPs to help them address these challenges.”
</p><p>
Many commercial health plans are now adding coverage for DPP as an in-network covered benefit, and Medicare coverage will begin in January 2018. Through the HealthSlate DPP Platform, many more diabetes education programs, healthcare providers and community-based organizations can offer DPP as insurance coverage becomes available.
